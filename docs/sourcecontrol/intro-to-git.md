# Intro Git in Visual Studio Code

## Introduction
Git and GitHub are powerful tools for managing code, collaborating with others, and keeping track of changes to your codebase. Whether you're new to coding or a seasoned professional, learning how to set up Git and GitHub in VS Code is a valuable skill to have.

VS Code's intuitive UI makes it easy for beginners to understand and perform common Git actions, such as pulling from and pushing to a remote repository, creating and merging branches, and staging and committing code changes. For seasoned professional, the ability to perform Git actions directly in the editor saves time and effort compared to using the Terminal. The integrated nature of VS Code's Git features also allows for a seamless workflow, without the need to switch between the editor and the Terminal.

## Setup Git in VS Code

To use Git and GitHub in VS Code, first make sure you have Git installed on your computer. If Git is missing the *Source Control* tab will show instructions on how to install it. Make sure to restart VS Code afterwards.

## Open a Git repository

VS Code provides several ways to get started in a Git repository.

### Clone a repository

To clone a repository from GitHub, execute the **Git: Clone** command or select the **Clone Repository** button in the **Source Control** view. If you clone from GitHub, VS Code will prompt you to authenticate with GitHub. This will allow you to search all available repositories and clone private repositories. For other Git providers enter the repository URL and select **Clone** and pick a folder. VS Code will open it once the repository has been cloned.

### Initialize a repository in a local folder

To initialize a new local repository, pick an existing or new folder on your computer and open it in VS Code. In the **Source Control** tab, select the **Initialize Repository** button. This will create a new Git repository in the current folder, allowing you to start tracking code changes.

#### Publish local repository to GitHub

Once you have a local Git repository set up, you can publish it to GitHub. This will create a new repository on your GitHub account, and push your local code to the remote repository. It is great for backing up your code, collaborating with others, and automating your workflow with GitHub Actions.

Use the **Publish to GitHub** command or the **Publish Repository** button in the **Source Control** tab. This will prompt you to authenticate with GitHub. You can then choose a name and description for the repository, and whether to make it public or private. Once the repository has been created, VS Code will push your local code to the remote repository.

### Open a GitHub repository in a Codespace

Codespaces let you to open a GitHub repository in a full configured cloud-based development environment, allowing you to develop in a browser without having to install any software on your local computer. They include free usage for individuals which makes it easy to getting started in open source.

Install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension into VS Code and sign in with GitHub. Run the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command and pick the repository and branch you want to open. The Codespace will open in a new window.

(Todo: Add video loop)

Alternatively, you can also start from a template from the [GitHub's Codespaces site](https://github.com/codespaces/templates). If you already have a Codespace open in your browser, you can open it in your Desktop VS Code by running the **Codespaces: Open in VS Code Desktop** command. Learn more about Codespaces to forwarding ports.

### Open a GitHub Repository remotely

VS Code remote repositories allows you to browse and edit a GitHub repository without cloning it to your local computer. This is useful for quickly making changes to a remote repository without having to clone the entire codebase to your local machine.

First install the the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) extension. Run the command **Remote Repositories: Open Remote Repository...** or use the **Open Remote Repository** button the Explorer view. Search and select the GitHub repository that you want to open.

(Todo: Add screenshot)

Browse, search, and edit files as you would in a local repository. Commit from the *Source Control* will go directly be integrated to the remote repository. The remote repository can not execute any code or run terminal commands.

## Staging and committing code changes

Once you have a Git repository set up, you can start tracking code changes by staging and committing your newly created and edited code.

Tip: Commit early and often. This will make it easier to revert to previous versions of your code if needed.

(Todo: Add screenshot for staging and committing)

To stage a file, select the **+** (plus) icon next to the file in the **Source Control** tab. This will add the file to the **Staged Changes** section, indicating that it will be included in the next commit. Staged changes can also be discarded by selecting the **âˆ’** (minus) icon next to the file.

To commit your staged changes, type a commit message and select the **Commit** button. This will save your changes to the local Git repository, allowing you to revert to previous versions of your code if needed. All file changes and commits are shown in the **Timeline** section.

(Todo: Add screenshot for timeline)

## Pushing and pulling remote changes

Once you have made commits to your local Git repository, you can push them to the remote repository. The **Sync** button will indicate how many commits are going to be pushed and pulled. selecting **Sync** button will download (pull) any new remote commits and upload (push) new local commits to the remote repository.

(todo: Add screenshot for sync)

> Tip: Make sure to enable **Git: Autofetch** to always get an up-to-date remote commit indicators.

 Push and pull can also be performed individually by using their respective commands.

## Using branches

In Git, branches allow you to work on multiple versions of your codebase simultaneously. This is useful for experimenting with new features or making large code changes without affecting the main codebase.

(todo: Add screenshot for branch indicator)

The branch dropdown in the status bar shows the current branch and lets you switch to new and existing branches. To create a new branch, select the branch indicator and choose to create it from the current branch or another local one. Type a name for the new branch, and confirm. This will create a new branch and switch you to it, allowing you to make changes to your code without affecting the main branch.

> Tip: If you use the GitHub Pull Request extension you can create a branch directly from an issue, which get you started coding in a new new local branch and automatically prefill the pull request for you.

To push the branch to the remote repository, select **Publish** in the **Source Control** tab. This will create a new branch on the remote repository, allowing you to collaborate with others on the branch.

### Creating and reviewing GitHub Pull Requests

In Git and GitHub, Pull Requests (PRs) are a way for collaborators to review and merge code changes from separate branches into the main branch. This allows teams to review and approve code changes before they are incorporated into the main codebase, ensuring that only high-quality code is merged.

To use Pull Requests in VS Code, you will need to install the [GitHub Pull Request & Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension. This extension adds PR and issue tracking functionality to VS Code, allowing you to create, review, and merge PRs from within the editor.

To create a PR, make sure you are on a separate branch from the main branch, and push your code changes to the remote repository. In the **Source Control** tab, select the **Create Pull Request** button. This will open the PR creation form, where you can enter a title and description for the PR, and choose which branch to merge the changes into. select **Create** to create the PR.

To review a PR, select the **Review Pull Request** button in the **Source Control** tab, and select the PR you want to review. This will open the PR in a new editor window, where you can review the code changes and leave comments. Once you are satisfied with the code changes, you can select the **Merge** button to merge the PR into the main branch.

Learn more about Pull Requests in the [VS Code's GitHub documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github).
